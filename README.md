# Therapist Chatbot

The chatbot_therapist.txt file is the running code at this point. This is the only file needed and all the other files at this point are stored data.

If you wish to use this, the simplest approach is to download the documents into a folder in Google CoLab and to run the chatbot through the run button. There should be plenty of tutorials and some online methods to run these through other means

If you upload your files to this repository, they will be public. 

Any questions you feel you would like to be asked on a given day, please add these to the relevant questions file or to create a .txt or json file with questions personally for you.

When you are done with each session, I would appreciate you uploading your files again to this repository; This is not necessary if there is information you wish to keep private. This uploading helps me build a database of possible questions and peoples answers to the questions; when I start improving this program to understand answers (using AI), these will help train the program to understand what sort of responses will create the best experience for you and others. I appreciate your help, and I hope this adds some value to your day. Much love, Duncan.

# Goals:

Stage 1: Making something usable:
-
- get this running on a server.
- create a gui even if simple. 
- asks for uploading and dealing with data privacy. 
- touch up code for run time;
- create multiple options to run off of different sets of questions. 
- test for usability
- respond to tests for further improvements.
- side project: create a little smiley face in the GUI to give the slightest 
      increase in sense of human interaction

Stage 2: Creating some understanding: text recognition:
- 
-
Stage 2a: Updating responses to this new data to create an experience of being heard
-
Questions:
-
- Is there a greater improvement through first adding voice recognition or facial emotional recognition?
- Is there a greater improvement through first adding a voice response or facial response?
- Response: for a UX point of view, having a voice before a face feels more natural What do you think?
- What are the technical and difficulty levels on each of these?

Stage 3: Improving understanding: Simple voice emotional and beat recognition for meaning:
- 

Stage 4: Voice feedback
-

Stage 5: Improving understanding: Simple facial emotion recognition: 
- 

Stage 6: Facial GUI Feedback
-

Stage 7: Iterations through this process for improvements:
- 
- Improving the hosting site for this app
- Possibly making this available in other formats across platforms
- Creating and curating question and follow-up data sets
- Inputing personal stories and guiding pieces of wisdom  for this AI to share with the user.
- Perhaps mining social media etc. for sites to train AI on; Do you have any ideas of where to look?
