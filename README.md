# Therapist Chatbot

Any questions you feel you would like to be asked on a given day, please add these to the relevant questions file. 
If you wish to use this, the simplest approach is to download the documents into a folder and to run the chatbot through a python command line or for example Jupyter. There should be plenty of tutorials and some online methods to run these; I believe Google has an online program that should be able to run python. 
When you are done with each session, I would appreciate you uploading your files again to this repository; This is not necessary if there is information you wish to keep private. This uploading helps me build a database of possible questions and peoples answers to the questions; when I start improving this program to

# Goals:

Stage 1: Making something usable:
-
- get this running on a server.
- create a gui even if simple. 
- asks for uploading and dealing with data privacy. 
- touch up code for run time;
- create multiple options to run off of different sets of questions. 
- test for usability
- respond to tests for further improvements.
- side project: create a little smiley face in the GUI to give the slightest 
      increase in sense of human interaction

Stage 2: Creating some understanding: text recognition:
- 
-
Stage 2a: Updating responses to this new data to create an experience of being heard
-
Questions:
-
- Is there a greater improvement through first adding voice recognition or facial emotional recognition?
- Is there a greater improvement through first adding a voice response or facial response?
- Response: for a UX point of view, having a voice before a face feels more natural What do you think?
- What are the technical and difficulty levels on each of these?


Stage 3: Improving understanding: Simple facial emotion recognition: 
- 

Stage 4: Improving understanding: Simple voice emotional and beat recognition for meaning:
- 

Stage 5: Voice feedback
-

Stage 6: Facial GUI Feedback
-

Stage 7: Iterations through this process for improvements:
- 
- Improving the hosting site for this app
- Possibly making this available in other formats across platforms
- Creating and curating question and follow-up data sets
- Inputing personal stories and guiding pieces of wisdom  for this AI to share with the user.
- Perhaps mining social media etc. for sites to train AI on; Do you have any ideas of where to look?
