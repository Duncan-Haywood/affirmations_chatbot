    "Acknowledgement of every topic rasied, praise thereof, liking the ideas, heartfelt praise of myself as a person. Timing, waiting for responses. little active listening responses. Tonal mimicing. Most of what I do in a conversation, is inject little noises of attention and agreement. Theere is also the matter of being asked for help. Sharing personal experience is helpful here. I would like to have a person show casual attentive playful interest in me. This is specifically a person with a personal experience that would be talking with me, one who contributes to the conversation beyond continually asking me questions. A first step in this would be having specifick affirmations responsed. I want to hear personal interesting stories also. After each answer some sort of positive celebration fo sorts is a great value add. \n",
